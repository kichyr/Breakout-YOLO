Breakout-YOLO is a classic browser game that can be controlled by gestures. See YOLO.pdf for details.
## TODO
- [ ] structure code
- [ ] add bounding box rendering in game
- [ ] move detection part to worker.js and use Worker API for parallelization of object detection and drawing
- [ ] add images without gestures to dataset(and train model on this) to decrease number of false positives
- [ ] recalculate anchor boxes for 256x256 and 192x192 models and train models with them
- [ ] add more gestures and game bonuses

cd flask
python app.py
```
+ go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/js/tfjs_draft.html in your browser to run demonstration
